# Disappearing-People - Person removal from complex backgrounds over time.
Removing people from complex backgrounds in real time using TensorFlow.js in the web browser using JavaScript.

## What can this demo do?

In this demo I attempt to learn over time the makeup of the background of a video such that I can attempt to remove any humans from the scene. This is all happening in real time, in the browser, using TensorFlow.js. 

This is an experiment. It will not be perfect, and it will not work in all situations. 

Right now the best use case is where you have a dynamic background where by no humans pass by anything that is moving in such dynamic background.
